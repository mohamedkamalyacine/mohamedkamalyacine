### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Electronics & Communications Engineer who is passionate about creating smart products with IoT technology. Iâ€™m proud to be one of the engineers who made our world as a one village. Learning how to learn is my slogan in life, this sentnce always makes me exiting to improve and learn more about technologies, especially in Embedded systems and IoT. So, I'm working in my programming skills (C, C++, python, JS).
